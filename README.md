A complete refocusation, reimagination and reimplementation of the world-renowned "Glitchy Engine"

# Building

In order to build this repository you need the following requirements:

- Windows 10 or newer
- [Beef](https://www.beeflang.org/) (at least 0.43.5)
- Visual Studio 2022 with the Workloads: "Desktop development with C++" and ".NET desktop development" (TODO: I think it's probably possible to just install some standalone stuff, but idk...)
- TODO: I feel like I'm missing something...

If all of the requirements are met you need to run the following command in powershell (in the root directory of the repository): `./bin/prepare_dev.ps1`. This will run a script that initializes the dependencies. TODO: This script is currently not finished
